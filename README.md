# Interview-Case-Study-DataAnalyst

## üè¢ Company
**Nordic Business Diversity Index (NBDI)**  
Case assignment for **Data Analyst Trainee 2026** position.

---

## üéØ Objective
Analyze the **educational diversity** of executive management teams using data from  
`Stockholm_Large_NBDI2025.xlsx`, converted to CSV and analyzed in **Google BigQuery**.

---

## üìä Task Overview
The goal was to evaluate how diverse executive management teams are in terms of **educational background**.  

Main objectives:
1. Clean and standardize company and executive data.  
2. Focus only on **Executive Management** (exclude Board of Directors).  
3. Normalize education fields into the following categories:
   - Business  
   - Law  
   - Engineering  
   - Sciences  
   - Humanities  
   - Medicine  
   - Arts  
   - Other / N/A  
4. Calculate for each company:
   - Number of executives  
   - Number of unique education categories  
   - Share of the most common education field  
   - **Diversity Score** = `1 - Œ£(p·µ¢¬≤)`, where `p·µ¢` is the share of executives per education category.

---

## üßπ Data Preparation (in BigQuery)
1. Converted the Excel file **`Stockholm_Large_NBDI2025.xlsx`** (sheet `"Data"`) into **`Stockholm_Large_NBDI2025.csv`** using Excel or Python (`pandas.to_csv()`).
2. Uploaded the CSV file to **Google BigQuery** using the **BigQuery Web UI**.  
3. Created a dataset and table named `cosmic-axe-464811-t3.Casestudyinterview.NBDI2025`. 
4. Verified column types (string, integer, etc.) and ensured UTF-8 encoding.

### Key Insights 
   üß≠ 1. Overall Trends

| Metric | Key Observation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Average diversity score** | Around **0.43‚Äì0.45**, indicating that most executive teams are dominated by one educational field. |
| **Typical share of top field** | Ranges between **0.5 and 0.7**, meaning one degree field represents half to two-thirds of the leadership team. |
| **Unique education fields per company** | Typically **3‚Äì4**, showing moderate interdisciplinarity. |
| **Team size vs. diversity** | Larger executive teams do **not necessarily** have higher educational diversity ‚Äî e.g., *Ericsson (17 execs, low diversity 0.29)* vs. *Saab AB (14 execs, high diversity 0.79)*. |

üß© **Conclusion:**  
The Nordic corporate landscape remains heavily shaped by **business and engineering backgrounds**, with limited academic heterogeneity overall.  
However, several companies show exceptional interdisciplinary leadership.
